### CI: COMPONENT IDENTIFICATION

**CI.6: DESIGN SECTION LOCATION**
- `dsLoc` is the location of a design section, which is specified as 150mm. This is likely related to the position of a structural component within a building or structure.

**CI.8: LOAD COMBINATION NAME**
- `loadCombName` represents the name of a load combination, and it's set to "1.25G+1.5Q+EQxx." Load combinations are used in structural analysis to account for different types of loads on a structure, such as dead loads (G), live loads (Q), and earthquake loads (EQ).

**CI.9: LOAD COMBINATION TYPE**
- `loadCombType` specifies the type of load combination, and it's set to "DEAD+LIVE+EARTHQUAKE." This indicates that the load combination includes dead loads, live loads, and earthquake loads. These are different scenarios used to analyze a structure's behavior.

**CI.10: LIMIT STATE**
- `limitState` defines the limit state being considered, and it's set to "ULS" (Ultimate Limit State). This is a condition where the structure is assessed for its ultimate strength or safety.

### IP: INPUT PARAMETERS

**B: BUILDING STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS**

**B.10: GEOMETRY OF THE STRUCTURE**

**B.10.8: OVERALL HEIGHT OF THE STRUCTURE**
- `H` represents the overall height of a structure, and it's set to 40m. This is the vertical measurement from the base to the top of the structure.

**B.8.1.1: HEIGHT OF THE STORY**
- `hs` specifies the height of each story or floor within the structure, and it's set to 3m. This is the height of one level within the building.

**B.8.1.2: NUMBER OF STORY**
- `Ns` represents the total number of stories or floors in the structure, and it's set to 10. This indicates there are ten levels in the building.

### C: SEISMIC DESIGN PARAMETERS

**C.7.1: STRUCTURAL DUCTILITY FACTOR FOR ULS**
- `μ` is the structural ductility factor for the Ultimate Limit State (ULS), and it's set to 3. Ductility relates to how much a structure can deform or stretch before failing, and this factor affects seismic design.

### CT: COMPONENT LEVEL PARAMETERS

**CT1: GLOBAL INPUT - MATERIAL PROPERTIES**

- `f'c` is the design compressive strength of concrete and is set to 40MPa. This represents the strength of the concrete used in the structure.
- `fy` is the design yield strength of steel and is set to 500MPa. This represents the strength of the steel used in the structure.
- `ε` represents the maximum concrete strain, and it's set to 0.003. This is a measure of how much the concrete can deform before failing.
- `cmax` and `Es` are not assigned values in this section but are likely used for further calculations related to materials.

**CT2: GLOBAL INPUT - STRENGTH REDUCTION FACTORS**

- `ϕ` is the strength reduction factor for flexure, and it's set to 0.85. This factor accounts for reduced strength in the structure under certain conditions.
- `ϕo` is not assigned a value in this section but may be used in later calculations.

**CT3: COMPONENT GEOMETRY**

- `L` represents the length of a beam and is set to 8m. This is the horizontal measurement of a structural element.
- `sw_s` is the support width at the beam's start point and is set to 300mm.
- `sw_e` is the support width at the beam's end point and is set to 450mm.
- `Ln` represents the clear span of the beam but is calculated based on `L`.

This section defines various parameters and values related to the structural components and materials used in the building. These parameters are essential for structural analysis and design.
